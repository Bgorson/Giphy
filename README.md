# Giphy
This is an Arrested Development themed GIF searcher. Users can click any pre-defined character button at the top to display 10 GIFS
that relate to the topic. USers then can click a button for 10 additional GIFS. After that, users can seek out individual GIFS with 
an increase in 'randomness'. 

Each GIF has a heart icon that when clicked, allows a user to keep a list of favorite GIFS. These GIFS are stored in local storage and 
can be displayed by clicking the "Favorites" button at any time. 

Navigation buttons stay on screen to allow users to enter inputs without scrolling up the page. 

Page is built using bootstrap, javascript and jquery.
